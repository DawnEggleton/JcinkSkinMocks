                                        Nik's archangel physiology bases off of Remiel, the archangel responsible for hope and known for clairvoyance and being the 'Thunder of God'. As such, his powers are themed around this.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        <tag-xs>wing manifestation</tag-xs><br>
                                        Nik has huge white-feathered wings that he can hide and show on command. They are large enough to allow for flight, and when he doesn't want them around anymore, they fall away into piles of feathers as if they were never there.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        <tag-xs>immortality</tag-xs><br>
                                        Although not completely impervious to injury, Nik is unable to die and his body has also stopped aging. It allows him to live without illness and survive injuries that most never would. This kicked in when he died at around thirty years old, thus why he still looks to be about that age and why he still has some scarring from previous injuries.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        <tag-xs>clairvoyance</tag-xs><br>
                                        Nik has a heightened sense of perception through his clairvoyance. He is unaware of this ability, beyond the fact that he tends to know when people are close even if they don't make a sound. It doesn't really extend beyond this and the occasional, general gut feeling about a situation.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        <tag-xs>electrical creation &amp; manipulation</tag-xs><br>
                                        Nik is capable of creating and manipulating electricity. He frequently uses this ability in his work and has spent a lot of time perfecting his control of it.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        <tag-xs>hope manipulation</tag-xs><br>
                                        Nik is capable of increasing someone's hope, or giving them hope when they are hopeless. He is entirely unaware of this ability and so it is almost constantly active.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        <tag-xs>soul manipulation</tag-xs><br>
                                        Along with manipulating hope, Nik can also manipulate souls. Specifically, Nik is capable of healing souls from damage, or making them impervious to it. Leaving a soul impervious to damage results in the person becoming immortal. He is entirely unaware of this ability and has yet to use it.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        <tag-xs>storm manipulation</tag-xs><br>
                                        Lastly, he is capable of manipulating rain and thunderstorms. This ability is heavily tied to his emotions and, on top of that, he is unaware of its existence, like many of his other abilities. He is capable of creating violent storms of the aforementioned nature, or of quelling them completely.

                                        The wings themselves are obviously large and cumbersome to enable flight, but what he finds most annoying about them is that every time he hides them he has to clean up huge piles of feathers from everywhere.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        <tag-xs>immortality</tag-xs><br>
                                        Although he comes back from the dead every time he is fatally injured, he doesn't heal any faster than the average person. The only time his injuries heal almost instantly is if he's died and come back to life. It is also incredibly painful to come back from the dead, making it an altogether unpleasant experience. Additionally, he's very adamant that not aging is overrated and a hassle, much like his wings (and he's not exactly wrong).<br>

                                        His clairvoyance isn't particularly detailed, so it's mostly useless. It does help him get a general sense of if he can trust someone or not, whether he's alone or not, and so on - but nothing more. He doesn't get straight up visions or clear pictures.<br>
                                        <br>

                                        Initially, this ability was very attached to his emotions. With decades of practice, it isn't anymore, but extreme emotions may still cause a bit of a reaction in the form of sparking fingers. This is especially true of panic.<br>

                                        <tag-xs>hope manipulation</tag-xs><br>
                                        In order to give people hope, Nik must first give up some of his own. He cannot outright manipulate levels of hope, only transfer it from himself to another human being. In theory, he could transfer it between people without involving himself, but he would have to be aware of his abilities to do that.<br>

                                        <tag-xs>soul manipulation</tag-xs><br>
                                        Although he can do a great many things with this ability, he is unable to damage a soul in any way. Additionally, it leaves him exhausted and vulnerable - his own immortality is sapped away for the duration of the process until such a time as he has recovered fully from it.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        <tag-xs>storm manipulation</tag-xs><br>
                                        He is incapable of affecting any storms other than rain and thunder/lightning storms. As they are tied to his emotions, a rough day can result in a terrible storm, and a good day usually has clear skies around him.

                                            <li>He has a number of scars from before his immortality, namely: a large gash on left side from side of rib cage to just below his belly button, cigarette burns on the top side of his lower arms, slashes sporadically across his back, a lichtenburg figure expanding out from his right collarbone across his chest, around his shoulder, and down his arm, and lastly a small starburst on his left ankle. He wears long sleeves to cover most of them.</li><br>
                                            <li>He will bake when stressed. He's an excellent baker, thankfully, but you can always tell how stressful a situation is by how easy he is to pull away from the kitchen and how many goodies he happens to whip up before he considers himself done.</li><br>
                                            <li>When he needs to think, he will find the highest possible point to sit on - often a rooftop of some kind.</li><br>
                                            <li>Particularly true when he is working on his research, he will lose track of time and forget to bath, eat, and sleep. Thankfully, he only actually needs to do one of those things to survive (and even that is more for the sake of others).</li><br>
                                            <li>When he gets incredibly stressed and can't escape through baking, he will often slip into his native tongue (Serbian). It's usually semi-incoherent rambles anyway, so it doesn't really hinder the conversation.</li><br>
                                            <li>Nik's first language is Serbian and he grew up in a town where Serbian and Croatian were both commonplace, so he is fluent in both. After the number of years he's been alive and his own memory, he is additionally fluent in English (and is able to hide his Serbian accent, which is typical of him), Russian, Italian, French, German, Spanish, and Latin. Latin is his favourite.</li><br>
                                            <li>Nik has an eidetic memory. That is, he doesn't forget pretty much anything. Ever. Blank spaces in his memory are incredibly unnerving to him, which only supports his insomnia way more than it needs to.</li><br>
                                            <li>He is absolutely an insomniac. Between forgetting to sleep, not wanting to sleep, and the nightmares, it's rare that he ever gets more than a couple hours a night, and nights spent without any sleep whatsoever are common.</li><br>

                                        You are two hours old when you are found on the doorstep of the church. The priest's wife had forgotten something after the Friday evening service and had run back to get it, only to find you and forget all about the scarf sitting in the pews. You weren't swaddled in anything and, although it was summer, it was still cold for a little babe as small as you were, and so she clutched you to her chest to keep you warm and brought you home. There was no doctor in your home town. In fact, there were less than five hundred people — none of which were your mother, no less, as none of the women were pregnant and then not. The lady had looked and looked for two weeks, caring for you and laying you to sleep in the crib her son had outgrown a few years ago. Eventually, her husband simply told her to stop. That you would be theirs, a brother to Danilo.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        That was your first word, too — your brother's name. Or, at least, an attempt at it. It came out more like <i>'an-ee'</i>, but it was something and you swear that, in the back of your too-full mind you can still see Dani's little grin and how he would jump with excitement whenever you spoke to him or about him, or whenever you reached for him. He always loved being your brother, was made for it you might say. He was gentle and loving and good. But he was too good, and nothing too good ever stayed in your life. Why would it? You were always destined to leave disaster in your wake. You should have been forgotten on that rural church doorstep and picked up by wolves. It would have been easier on everyone.<br>
                                        <br>

                                        You are five years old (five years, ten hours, three minutes, to be exact) when it becomes clear to your tiny child's mind that you are not meant for good things. It is your birthday and your mother is baking some baklava for you, your dad is whittling away to try and frantically finish a beautiful carving of galloping horses for over top your bed, and Danilo is determined to take you out for a trail ride. You don't ride the family horse alone yet, except at a walk with someone leading her, but he tosses you up onto the saddle and then climbs up after you, wrapping an arm firmly around your waist. He isn't large, not really, but to you he's practically an adult, a good five years, eight months, three days, and twenty two hours older than you. It doesn't help that he is tall and lanky, while you are still short, even if you don't really have any baby fat anywhere but your cheeks. It doesn't matter, though, because he is your favourite person in the whole world and he's determined to make today the best day ever for you, as he is every birthday.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        It had rained the night before, so the ground is wet, the dirt turned to mud, and the grass slick under the mare's feet. You remember each vivid detail, can relive it in your own personal movie theatre in your head whenever you wish and often even when you don't. You have only ever seen this gift as a curse, but not because of that specific moment — rather, for every moment that comes after it, beginning with the long stretch that you've seen Dani gallop the mare down more often than not. You beg him, pretty please, let her go faster. You are happy, but a walk is boring and you don't need Dani with you to stay on at a walk. You peer up at him with your big, blue eyes and a little pout and even though he knows it's not a good idea with the footing, he doesn't say a word to you, grins back, and gives the mare a kick to push her to a trot. Before long, you're cantering across the field, grinning and giggling and nearly bouncing right out of the saddle, only held in place by Dani's arm securely around your waist.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        And then the mare slips. The whole world turns to slow motion and you fly through the air, Dani flying further and soaring right over you. You hear a crack, but you don't register what that crack is as you hit the ground with a thud. You are scared and bruised, but barely hurt, just having a little trouble breathing, so you scramble to your feet to try and catch the mare (dad will kill you if you lose her) and you manage in time to slip yourself, the dragging reins catching around your throat as she panics and bolts. You are pulled free by a rock that lodges in your side, but you are too desperate for air to feel the pain. The rock comes dislodged, stuck more firmly in the ground than it is in you, when you stand, whimpering instantly as the pain sets in, but you stumble to Dani's body, laying in the grass and not moving. His head is next to another rock, but you don't see the red of the blood, collapsing next to him. You shake him and scream at him and cry. You keep going until you pass out and you wake up without a voice from all the screams. You are in your bed, laceration stitched and covered, and on the road to recovery. Dani, on the other hand, is in the ground underneath a crooked tombstone.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Your mind latches onto the idea that you killed your brother, and it never quite lets loose of that guilt.<br>
                                        <br>

                                        You are six and you haven't seen your mother — no, not your mother, Anika — in a few months. You have suffered through harsh words from Luka (your 'father'). You aren't sure how many to believe, but you believe him when he says you are not theirs. You are just a charity case, sent by God to test their faith as you destroy their family. Anika has locked herself away in the bedroom, refusing to see anyone most days and, while Luka will enter anyway, he doesn't allow you in. You don't deserve to see her anyway, he says. Instead, you look after little Marica. She was only a few months old when Danilo died, so she'll never remember him, but you are determined to be the same sort of brother to her that Dani was to you, even if you aren't her brother at all. She smiles and laughs when she sees you — she laughs a lot, it is the only thing you live for — so you figure you must be doing something right.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Of course, when her first word was <i>'ik'</i> for Nikolas, that was the first day you felt the sting of a hand across your face, so not everything associated with her is good. But you try to make it all okay anyway.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        You are only eight when you first feel the burn of a cigarette on your skin. You scream and cry at the pain, so you are forced to endure another, and another, and another, until you suffer through it in silence, tears streaming down your face, but your teeth gritted to keep them closed. <i>You don't want to wake Mari,</i> Luka whispers in your ear. You know then that it will not be the last time, but that you must be quiet or it will be worse. You duck your head to avoid his eyes, glossed over with the stupor of whiskey, and murmur a soft <i>'yes, sir'</i>, before you scurry off to go cook the lunch you were late getting done for him. It should be on the table when he gets home, you know, but Mari hadn't wanted to have her nap, and that had delayed you. Luka didn't like excuses; you didn't bother telling him any of them ever again.<br>
                                        <br>

                                        You are almost seventeen and you have fallen behind in your schooling, as someone has to stay home to care for Anika now that Luka has tired of it. Luka still preaches, but all of that money is spent on alcohol and cigarettes except the little bits you steal from the coin jar and the small allowance he gives Marica, which you pool to get groceries. Usually you don't get much, because Luka eats a lot and you don't want to take away from Mari or Anika's plates because Mari is still growing and Anika never did anything wrong to you besides mistake you for Dani sometimes. You don't blame her for that, though; she hasn't been there, mentally, since his death and you're pretty sure she never actually accepted that he was gone. Luka still hits you and burns you when you do something wrong (you do something wrong a lot), but you have also been target practice for a few years now and your back bears the scars of bottles that sliced open your skin. He laughs when that happens. You aren't sure how it's funny, but if you laugh too, he doesn't ask you to bring the bottles back so he can throw them again, so you learn to laugh.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        You aren't sure how much more of this you can take, even if you're certain you deserve most of it, and so you pack a small bag with ragged clothes that don't quite fit and a bottle of water and some food that will last and you head out across the fields. Maybe you can find a job in the city, you figure. You just have to get there first. You've never been, but you've studied maps and you know which direction is which, so you just need to head the right way and you'll be there, eventually. You can live under a bridge or in a shelter if you find one (somewhere that someone doesn't hit you every day) and you can find a place to work and you can earn money and eventually get out of this hellhole. You aren't sure where you'll go - probably just the first place you can get to that's farther away, and the sooner the better.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        You don't quite make it to the city, though you come close, before a storm rolls in overhead. There are no trees in sight, no shelter, so you press on, at least at first. You don't have time to think about what is about to happen when a stray lightning bolt arcs down to you, the tallest thing for miles. In fact, it is so fast that you don't even see it coming. All you feel is a searing pain, your muscles seizing and your chest feeling tight. You try to move, to scream, to shout, to do anything, but you can't and then everything is black.<br>
                                        <br>

                                        You are now seventeen, but barely, when you finally awake in a hospital bed. You momentarily wish that it was all a bad dream and you're still five, but the pain isn't in the right places, so you know it isn't true. This time, you are far more limited in your mobility. Your whole right shoulder and upper arm is immobilized — shattered collarbone — and your left ankle is in a cast — cracked, but not as bad as your shoulder — and beyond that your muscles are so weak that lifting a finger feels like lifting a bag of bricks. You are later told that you were clinically dead for a minute or two, but luckily someone had been passing by and spotted you, bringing you to the hospital instantly. You wish you hadn't survived. The darkness that you found in death was peaceful, the first time you have experienced peace in your life except when Dani was alive. Maybe it was because you were with him again, you think. You'd like that, joining him. It would be easier.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        You don't get many visitors as you lay in your bed, in pain and wanting it to end, but you do get one. A British professor who had been in town for work; the man who found you and saved you. He brings his son, sometimes, an energetic young man named Nigel who will eventually become your best friend, but for now he is nothing more than a nuisance who never lets you get away with flipping off your doctors. When he catches wind of the fact that you aren't cooperative unless he's there, he is sure to be there every day, and eventually you are actually getting better — physically and mentally. He is good for you. He makes you smile. He even makes you laugh, something you haven't done since that horseback ride before your world turned upside down. You don't tell him anything, but he seems to know that there's more to you than some <i>'poor, unfortunate sod'</i> who got struck by lightning. Then again, you are his age and he has never seen your parents, never seen a get well card or bouquet or balloon. He gets the hint pretty fast that there isn't anyone looking out for you except you and, now, him. So the next time you wake up, you open your eyes to a room so full of balloons and flowers that the nurses can barely do their job. You refuse to see him for days, needing time to figure out how to say thank you, a phrase so foreign to you that you hope it's enough. He just laughs at you and your bright-red cheeks and tells you to <i>'get up already, it's time to try walking'</i>. So you get up. You don't walk that day, but it isn't long before he's dragging you around the city anyway.<br>
                                        <br>

                                        You are seventeen and two months when Nigel has to return to London. You are walking again and you are ready to be discharged as well, but when he asks you where his father should drive you to before they go to the train station, you hesitate. He doesn't even miss a beat before calling his father to buy another ticket and get a rushed passport so that you can join them. He's helped you catch up on your schoolwork, and you ran with it, going further now that you have access to libraries, so you are certain that you will be fine in an English school even if your Serbian accent is still heavy. You find out that there's no need to worry, though, because Nigel doesn't go to school; he is home schooled, instead, and so you are too. You find a way to send a letter to Marica and let her know that you are going to London with your friend. She says she'll miss you, but that you better have fun and bring her back a souvenir. You tell her that you will and give her the Griffin's home address so she can call you if she needs to.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        You spend the next year traipsing around London streets, with trips to all the other little towns that are close. You have the time of your life and you begin to think that you are free, that nothing will ever have to change and that you can be this way forever. Maybe you have finally paid your penance for killing Dani.<br>
                                        <br>

                                        You are eighteen and three months, just over a year after you followed Nigel to London, when there's a knock on the door during dinner and there is Luka, face red with anger. You don't get to say goodbye or grab your things. He grabs your arm — your right one, the one that still aches from time to time, so it hurts even more — and he drags you to the cab and to the train and back home. His hands leave marks on your skin from how tight he grips you, but you remember how this goes; don't cry, and it won't get worse.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        But things have changed. Now there are no rules.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        You wake in the morning, still on the kitchen floor where he left you, your whole body black and blue. You recognize the dull ache that changes to sharp stabbing when you breathe (broken ribs). You rub under your nose to lift off flakes of dried blood, tenderly pinching at it and thankful that it is at least not broken (or, doesn't seem to be). You slowly sit up, barely able to, but you stand and you check the clock and you have thirty minutes to get his breakfast ready, and so you do. You fall into routine and you realize that you weren't free at all and that the worst pain, out of everything you have endured, is realizing the security and hope that you felt was fake.<br>

                                        You are twenty years, nine months, and three days old when you have finally saved enough from the coin jar and Mari's allowance to walk, again, to the city and catch a train to London. You show up on the Griffin's doorstep, just as bruised as the morning you woke up on the kitchen floor, tears streaming down your face, and they welcome you back with open arms. Sophie, Nigel's mother, doesn't let you out of her arms for a solid three hours, and once she does, she is in the kitchen making your favourite things and sending word to Nigel to tell him you are here. He rushes home to see you and then he does the same thing. You didn't cry when Sophie held you, but the second Nigel's arms are around you, you are silently leaking tears onto his shoulder. It soaks his shirt, so he must have noticed, but he doesn't say anything. He just tells you that he'll make up the spare room for you after dinner and then tomorrow you're going to the University to register for classes - whatever you wanted to take.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        You are shocked when they actually allow you into the classes you request (Nigel is not). You aren't used to people wanting you, but you have never been happier in your life than you are to have the opportunity to study the sciences. You need it, at first. You've never really had stable and it feels good. But you also need a plan for what you want to do in life. The Griffins say you don't, that they'd pay anyway for you to keep going because you didn't get to think about it before now anyway and you can't be expected to rush your decision. But you don't need to rush. You try to take your time, but you end up going with the first thing that makes your heart leap in excitement every time you step through the door of the classroom: electricity and physics.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        You study hard, even though it comes naturally to you and it isn't as tough as everyone says it is. You are a natural, they assure you, and they see bright things in your future. Their praise makes you glow - at first, red from embarrassment, and then later you just glow with a big grin on your face.<br>

                                        You never thought you'd go back home; why would you? It wasn't really home to you and it never had been. Instead, home was the small flat you shared with Nigel, that you returned to every night after helping try to encode and decode various messages for the Allied Forces during the War. You receive the letter from Marica, though, that states the Ustaše are getting restless. They were not known for kindness, especially to Serbs and other minority ethnic groups, and the war had empowered them to take action. There was word they were headed to Smiljan next. You didn't wait to write her back. You just packed your things, left a note for Nigel, and caught the first train that would take you close, even if it meant risking your own life.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        You arrive too late; a massacre lays on the steps of your father's church and inside it. He is there, dead where he was praying, and you rush to the small farmhouse in hopes that maybe, just maybe, Anika or Marica made it out alive. You pass your sister's body on the way, but you are in shock and too numb to really recognize it. You do find Anika, huddled in the closet, shaking. She reaches out for you, calling you by your brother's name, and you scoop her up in your arms, noting how frail she has gotten, and head back the way you have come, intending to take her with you to London. There is nothing left here for you anymore, after all.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        You aren't even aware it has happened until you wake up to Anika's screams being silenced and a hole through your shirt where a bullet went through it. Your fingers rise to touch the blood, staring at how they come away red but the hole is not there. You hear the cries - <i>'đavo, đavo!'</i> - proclaiming you a devil and you realize, then, that maybe all those times you touched the blackness and came back were not truly death at all. It should have terrified you; instead, it empowered you. There were so few of the radical Croats left that you didn't really dent their ranks — but you made sure those remaining did not live to tell of the death toll on your village.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        That said, their pleas for mercy still haunt your dreams, more than Luka ever had.<br>

                                        Your return to London is not triumphant or extraordinary. You return to the life you were living before you left, but you are quiet once more. Nigel notices the change, but nothing he does can help. Your work suffers, but you are still the brightest mind they have working there at the time, so they say nothing. You suffer through to the end of the war, but once you no longer have a job to pull you out of the apartment every day, you stop leaving. It doesn't quite get better, so you tell Nigel you are leaving and you aren't sure when you will be back. He makes you promise to write, clearly concerned, but lets you go.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        You try to find your ground again, something to stand on. You become a wandering soul, never staying in one place for too long. Europe holds no charm for you, so you go overseas in case that might prove different. It doesn't. The years pass. You and your promise are forgotten; lost to the wind, much like the innocence your mind clung to until that last day in Smiljan. You eventually return to London, more for Nigel's sake than anything, but you haven't aged since that day when you truly died and then came back to life. In comparison, he is a haggard old man. You didn't realize how long it had been, but he'd always been the understanding sort and he took to this revelation well enough. You stay with him until it is no longer feasible and people will recognize your lack of aging, and then he helps you fake your death. You live in forests and cabins and, sometimes when you need to be near the sound of a city, catacombs and tunnels beneath the main streets. Life passes you by and for the longest time, you are content to let it.<br>
                                        <br>

                                        Over the decades, you came and went from society. You could never stay too long, for fear people would get suspicious — never mind how they seemed to get louder and brasher every trip back. It almost made you want to give up completely, but there was this company that showed promise and, honestly, you needed access to their labs. You'd been trying since Smiljan to figure out what had happened to you, and why — and, eventually, your hand-built machines just didn't cut it. So you stayed late at work, ran extra tests on incorrectly labelled samples that were from you. Slowly, you found answers.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        But they found them not long after. You can help but wonder if they were tracking your research, even if the only files you kept were in your head. You sat and watched in the sidelines a little at first, getting yourself on the project so that you could keep an eye. None of it was too far away from legal, and you were comfortable enough with the gray to accept it. After all, it was only blood draws, tissue samples. As far as you could tell, they were all there willingly. But— then again, you weren't the one <i>taking</i> the samples. You were strictly in the lab.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Something didn't feel right, with how these samples appeared out of thin air with no details as to the patients, though, and you couldn't put it to rest. You'd been around the block a time or three. You knew how to check their systems. The flashbacks to the War left you sleepless for days after you watched the tapes. You tried to tell them this wasn't the way, that they didn't have to do this — and you got told to get on board or get out. You, obviously, chose the latter.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        But how, exactly, did you tell someone without outing why you felt so passionately about the subject? You simply couldn't picture it, not without Nigel by your side, bold and bigger than life, and so you moved to the coast and bought up one of the warehouses to get some space, only to find out just how much of a <i>stronghold</i> Quantum had in this godforsaken, crumbling city. it sickened you.... but not as much as it terrified you that they all but ruled the science department at the university. You couldn't help but think, <i>'this is how it starts'</i>. You get a faculty position. With your intelligence and your resume, you are a shoe-in. They hire you in an instant. There's just one problem.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        You have no idea what to do <i>next</i>.
