For local development of Jcink skin assets

**To Install**

Clone the repo to a folder of choice on your computer. Navigate into the repo using your command line interface (CLI).

**To Run**

`npm run sass` will build the .scss files into a single styles.css stylesheet

`npm run prefix` will take your styles.css stylesheet and autoprefix it to be compatible with browsers wherever possible, then stored this in prefixed/styles.css

The project runs off the styles.css sheet created in the SASS build and will update on page refresh every time you save any of your .scss files.
