        Aiden is... a mess. He dedicates himself wholly to his job for the sake of forgetting about his dead husband, except it's damn near impossible to forget when his husband died in the line of duty doing the <i>same job</i>. His coping capabilities is set at <i>nil</i>, what with rebound sex within two weeks of the funeral, not talking about it, keeping his husband's last name, and continuing to wear his wedding ring — even now, only taking it off when he's out with the intent of picking someone up. He's trying this dating thing again, and he is Not Keen <sup>tm</sup> but he's hoping it will get Autumn off his back. He's well-intentioned and damn good at his job, though, and if you exclude his <i>awful</i> decision making skills in the romance department, he's actually pretty bright and gives stellar advice. He just needs to.... listen to some of that advice himself.<br>

        Hailing from America, Mickey is the classic case of middle child syndrome that did not too bad for himself. Growing up, he was always in the older shadow of his brother, Henry, but he loved him enough to not particularly mind. However, when his brother came out, his parents lost all fondness for him and thought it was a blight on the pureblood name of the Rose family. Since then, Mickey has been trying to balance his parents’ newfound expectations of him and what he actually wants to do in life.<br>
        <br>
        He enjoys his job as an Unspeakable well enough, but there’s a lot of things about his life his parents wouldn’t be pleased to hear about. Such as his obsession with old Hollywood Muggle movies, his affinity for dressing like Gonzo from the Muppets and the fact that his ex-fiancee is actually a lesbian but they’re still living together because they’re always going to be best friends. And on top of that, Mickey is having some serious doubts about his own sexuality but has told exactly no one about it. Which is a whole thing.<br>
        <br>
        <center><h1>wanted plots</h1></center><br>
        <br>
        Work friends. Give me fellow Unspeakables who have no idea how this multi-coloured American ended up in the Hall of Prophecies but they’ve learned to get along with him anyway.<br>
        Muggle friends. I’d particularly love for him to get along with a few Muggles that his parents wouldn’t approve of because, in all honesty, he’s a lot more fascinated by their culture than he is by anything wizardkind and I think it would be cute for him to nerd out over games consoles and pop culture.<br>
        Please give this guy a man to have crush on so he can hurry up and realise just how bisexual he is. I need it so bad.<br>

        No hard no’s here, I’m up for pretty much anything with Mickey!<br>`,
