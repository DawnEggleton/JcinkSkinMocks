                                <b>+</b> Duncan organizes his book shelves by spine color and always has.<br>
                                <b>+</b> He writes diary entries, but on a typewriter rather than by hand. The entries are stored in a file folder that is never out of reach, or burned so no one else can read them.<br>
                                <b>+</b> He doesn't eat many sweets, but when he goes to the movies, he is the one who dumps bags of candy and chocolate into his popcorn to create something more akin to a weird trail mix.<br>
                                <b>+</b> Duncan is just starting to come out as gay a little more openly now. He always knew he was and he didn't have a personal problem with it, but one of his gut feelings told him that telling people at home wasn't a good idea and so he didn't. It then became so easy to just not tell most people, so now it's a bad habit he's trying to break.<br>
                                <b>+</b> Duncan has been a volunteer aide worker ever since he left home at eighteen. He has traveled and seen most of the world, particularly the rougher parts of it, and he's become quite skilled at numerous construction tasks as well as basic medical care.<br>
                                <b>+</b> There was a young boy he met once during his travels who he nearly adopted and settled down back at home with. No one knows this because, in the end, it didn't work out, but he has always regretted not taking on some of the other kids he met before, or has met since.

                                    <center><h5>there's a little house on a perfect little hill, just short of a fairytale</h5></center>
                                    You don't realize, at first, that this isn't exactly how it's supposed to be. You grow up in a too-small house and a too-big family, but it starts out as comfortable. You are the quiet child, the one who never fussed and never really caused any problems. You kept to yourself and stuck your nose in books. You didn't quite belong amid the rough-housing antics of your two older brothers, but you were too young to mind much until the fourth came along and even he fit in a little better than you ever had, never mind the fifth and how she was almost born to be apart of their little group. You tried not to let it bother you, but it did.
                                    
                                    What bothered you more, though, was how it didn't matter that you never did anything wrong. You may as well have been invisible until the moment when you weren't and then it was raised voices and stinging hands across your face. You thought at first that, maybe, you deserved it. You had done well, but not well enough. You missed a spot on the dishes, or your ninety-five percent test should have been one hundred percent. You were too smart to believe this for long, though. You figured it out by the time you were eight and a half when you came home bouncing with a perfect score on your latest math test and you were still hit anyway.
                                    
                                    You were nine when you learned to stay out of the house more to avoid it, spending hours and hours at the library, but not too many, because that meant you would get yelled at or smacked more. It was a fine line to walk, and you found the balance as easily as you breathed the air around you. Instead of focusing on being the best son, you focused on never, ever slipping and falling from that line. You weren't sure you could recover if you did.
                                    
                                    <center><h5>there's a little child with a million ways to feel caught up in a hurricane</h5></center>
                                    You knew about it before everyone else. You weren't quite sure what you knew, but you knew it. It woke you up in the middle of the night, this overwhelming feeling of desperation. This happened when you were ten, though you didn't understand it until you were twelve and your father died. By this time, they had to let you know by owl - you were at Hogwarts, having taken after him in at least one way, if no other. They told you he was shot in a random drive-by at the local coffee shop, that it was a muggle-based mishap, but something in that didn't sit right. In fact, nothing had sat right for the near-two-years leading up to it. You had started to piece together by now that it wasn't a normal sense of intuition, but this confirmed it for you. You remember cautiously watching your words around your family so they never figured out that you had already known. This was the first of many secrets you learned to keep.
                                    
                                    The second secret you learn to keep is one you had actually been keeping a lot longer, but didn't realize: you are gay. When you come to that conclusion, you feel almost sick to your stomach at the thought of telling your family and so you don't. Together, these secrets eat away at your childhood and whatever innocence remains. You begin to think there is something wrong with you, that this is why you have never fit in. Somehow, this is how it makes sense to you. That you are the quiet brother because you like boys. That you are the sensitive brother because you are meant to hurt, to pay for this flaw in who you are. It gets harder to handle, day by day, until all you do is keep secrets. Your grades drop. You skip classes. You wait until your dormmates are asleep to cry, losing precious sleep. You pull away further as if that is somehow possible. You close off to everyone and no one notices. Why would they? You have always been invisible until that moment you are not.
                                    
                                    This time, though, it isn't screaming and hands-on your face that makes you seen. It is the fact that, at the young age of fourteen when you are home for the summer, you have a handful of pills in the palm of your left hand and a glass of water in your right. You were planning on going quietly, no mess and no fuss, just like you. Something in you wants to swallow them. Another part feels that flutter in your heart that someone is going to catch you, but it isn't fear. It's a sense of knowing that you have come to recognize. By the time your brother opens the bathroom door, the pills are back in the bottle, but you freeze anyway. His eyes, unknowing of what he has interrupted, meet your red and puffy ones and you just crumple to the floor. The dried tear stain tracks on your cheeks were washed away by fresh tears and it was then you realized you weren't alone. You try to do better, to be better, and your brother is always there to catch you when you fail, even if your parents aren't.
                                    
                                    <center><h5>always used to be the one to let it go, kept my fears in a suitcase</h5></center>
                                    
                                    You started by finding solace in being near your older brother, in particular, the one that had inadvertently saved your life. You had never been terribly close to your family or hadn't seen yourself as such anyway, but everything changed that one evening he had found you and held you close as you sobbed on the bathroom floor. The problem was that he was only around for a short while more after that particular incident, a few years between you. The owl-delivered letters and summertime visits just weren't enough. One person probably wasn't enough, but he was all you had. So, your life improved for a little bit, and then it spiralled back down.
                                    
                                    You found that, when provided with enough to do, it was easier to get out of your own head, though, and so you kept busy. You joined about a million clubs until you found the ones that stuck. You volunteered to help the teachers and the younger students every chance you got. During the summer, when you were back home, you volunteered for the church your mother insisted you go to every Sunday. At first, around town, and then on their summer trips. By the time you graduated from high school, you had no idea what to do with your life, just that you wanted to help people. You try to be good for your mother and leave magic behind because for all her faults in raising you, you still sort of love her. You go to university for a science program, because you were good at it and it was a little like potions, but you dropped out partway through the program when you were given the opportunity to go abroad to help developing nations and war-torn cities recovering from the muggle wars that never seemed to end. Your heart just wasn't in school anymore, no matter how good you were at it. Neither was the path of a wizard, but you also convince yourself that that is alright, even though a small part of you dies inside a little every day when you keep yet another secret.
                                    
                                    You proceeded to spend the next thirteen years of your life bouncing in and out of country after country, disaster zone after disaster zone, only coming back to London every year or so to reassure everyone that you were alive and well. Finally, for the first time in your life, you could more or less forget about the sadness that plagued you. You weren't sure if it was the exhaustion or the jet-lag or the fact you could only survive this by thinking about them more than you, but something in this nomadic life helped soothe you like no person ever could. Finally, you were flourishing.
                                    
                                    <center><h5>there's a ghost in the back of this room, and i don't like it</h5></center>
                                    To be fair, you had always been playing with fire. You went where you were needed most, and these places ranged from small farming villages that had no clean water to cities ravaged by natural disasters. Very rarely, you found yourself somewhere completely different. War-torn countries, still facing strict regimes and fighting between sides, were not normal in your little stints away from home, but there was something about this particular cause that called you to it. The fighting was supposed to be over, with rebuilding having started months prior, and so you agreed to go and help build a shelter for the orphaned children. You had a feeling from the moment your plane touched down that something was going to go wrong, but you couldn't place your finger on it until three days before your time there was set to be over.
                                    
                                    You knew it was coming before you ever heard the tick-tick-tick echoing in the empty hall, but it still didn't prepare you for the sheer deafening loudness of a bomb or the piercing pain of shrapnel. Your ears rang as you struggled to sit up, covered in the dust of drywall, vision blurred and spinning. Some of the villagers who had been helping to build the school alongside you rushed in to drag you out. You remember trying to thank them, but it fell on deaf ears with the pops of gunfire that managed to, somehow, be heard despite the fact you still couldn't hear much else. You dragged yourself to your feet, limping over to the only cover you could find and you curled in a ball.
                                    
                                    By the time they found you, you had ended up buried in a crumbling part of the building. You could hear again, of course, but the cuts on your skin had been covered in dirt for days, your leg trapped under a piece of concrete. Not enough to stop circulation, so they called you lucky when they finally dug you out, but you didn't feel lucky. What was lucky about almost being blown up, or almost losing your leg? Nothing. If you had to feel anything, it was nothing short of terrified. You didn't like the feeling, though, so you chose instead to feel nothing. Or you tried; you'd never been very good at it.
                                    
                                    <center><h5>i told myself i wouldn't be scared, but i'm still having nightmares</h5></center>
                                    They flew you out to a hospital in Germany for your recovery, stuck you on high dose antibiotics for your wounds, cleaned them up, sewed them shut. They brought you into surgery to fix your leg and did a good enough job that, after some time to heal and some physiotherapy, you don't limp often anymore, though you guess that arthritis is going to be a bitch in a few years. You weren't conscious enough to direct yourself to St. Mungo's, though - not in time, anyway. It's too late to fix it now, so you console yourself with the fact this is a military hospital and they have seen far worse than this.
                                    
                                    After surgery, when you know you will be okay, you send an owl to your brother before he worries. You inform him that you're going to be away longer than you thought, something that could have been done with a phone call but writing it makes it easier to believe. It isn't entirely a lie, so he can't be mad at you. It isn't descriptive enough to tell him what happened, though, so you suspect he might be anyway. You can't blame him, but you also aren't sure how to tell him that you're too afraid to go back. You haven't faced the fact you are afraid yet. You don't want to.
                                    
                                    When you finally heal enough to be released, you find yourself wandering the streets of Berlin. They couldn't get you a flight home immediately, and your wand was lost in the rubble so it wasn't like you could apparate back home. You like it, at first, until a car door slams or a child screams and you find your heart racing and your eyes searching for the nearest place you can take cover. This is when you finally admit to yourself that, maybe, you need help. You don't admit it to anyone else. You just get on your plane back to London and you find yourself showing up on your brother's doorstep with a fake smile, pretending everything is fine and your life hasn't been shattered into tiny pieces that may never fit back together.
                                    
                                    It is all you can do to not break down the second you see him, narrowly avoiding crumpling to the floor again just like when you were fourteen. You ask for a room, as you always do, and he gives it to you, as he always does. For the first time in thirteen and a half years, you cry yourself to sleep as the weight of the world crashes down on your chest, knocking the wind right out of you. You should tell your brother and you know this. Instead, you find yourself playing along as if everything is fine. It isn't, of course. In fact, you're fairly certain it will never be fine again.
                                    
                                    You can't keep the lie up long enough to stay there, though, and so you first get a puppy - a little dachshund called Elliot who, when you feel your heart start to beat too fast, will come over and lay his head on you with big sad eyes and a slight wag of his tail and who will let you hold him as long and as tight as you need to feel better. Then, you reach out to Hogwarts. It had felt restricting, before, when you were there last - but it <i>had</i> always felt somewhat safe, and safe was what you needed right now. You didn't really have qualifications, but they sweep you into their ranks anyway as apparently they needed help in the library and you <i>did</i> love books. Your brother is skeptical when you leave for someone so... <i>different</i>, but you do what you do best: you leave before he can ask questions you don't want to answer, and that is that. You settle into your quarters there, with your too-soft bed and the quiet that precedes the start of the semester, and for the first time since the bomb, you find you can breathe again. That may change, but for now, you are alright.
                                    
                                    Or, that's what you keep telling yourself.

                                    <h1>Overview</h1>
                                    Duncan Taggart is the black sheep in his family. Never very athletic, always had his nose stuck in a book - and suffering, quietly, inside, the whole time. He became quite close to one of his older brothers after an almost-suicide attempt when he was fourteen. They have remained close, even though Duncan has spent nearly all of his adult life travelling the globe to help aide disaster zones, developing nations, and war zones and so has kind of been really absent. Overall, he's a quiet man who tends to keep a little more to himself. He's sensitive, and this is brought to an extreme by the trauma he's recently been through, reacting to more than just his intuition and other people's actions now (because nearly being blown up can do that to a person).
                                    
                                    He's only recently settled down at Hogwarts, so his near-death experience is absolutely still fresh in his mind. It doesn't help that he's a seer, and he sort of, in part, saw it coming. His abilities don't get him as many details as he'd like and are typically more than a little useless, but he still often regrets not "listening" to them more. He's trying to, now, but it's overwhelming and so he's sidled away to somewhere quieter and more remote - Hogwarts - with a dog that is, technically, an emotional support animal, not that he's admitted that to anyone. All they know is that he is <i>never</i> without Elliot, which the students tend to enjoy at least.
                                    
                                    <h1>Friends</h1>
                                    Although quiet, Duck is a fairly social person. He doesn't like to talk much, necessarily, and he doesn't really like large crowds because of the noise, but he <i>does</i> enjoy being near other people. Even large groups, honestly - it's not the number of people that does him in, it's the <i>volume</i>, and that's something he's working on. He just hasn't gotten very far with it. That said, the more comfortable he is in his surroundings, the more social and outgoing he will be. He's very used to being around anyone who's rambunctious, given that's the majority of his family, so that certainly won't be an issue for him. Honestly, the boy just needs some friends. He's awfully lonely and he doesn't do super well alone. People to listen, to just <i>be there</i> for him, is all he really needs. In return, he'll happily do the same - he might even have some words of wisdom to share, after all his years of travel. He's certainly seen plenty.
                                    
                                    <h1>Foes</h1>
                                    Duck isn't the sort to end up making a lot of enemies. He sticks to himself and he's pretty quiet when he doesn't. Sure, he's just not going to mesh with some people - and that's okay, and he knows that's okay. It doesn't bother him. He'll stay polite and civil with them, regardless of the situation, because he doesn't really know any other way. He's used to having to avoid or defuse a rough situation, and he does the exact same in his adult life.
                                    
                                    <h1>Flames</h1>
                                    Sort of new to the scene in this regard, Duck was never really in a position to be in a relationship with anyone. He grew up in an abusive situation, which meant he didn't really have the time or energy to even consider dating (never mind the fact that, even then, he knew he was gay - and that his parents wouldn't approve). After that, he was travelling the world trying to help repair the damage from others for well over a decade, and not staying in one place for very long <i>also</i> isn't very conducive to a relationship. Needless to say, when I say <i>new</i>, he is <i>very</i> new. He's tentative and awkward and uncertain and he certainly won't <i>intentionally</i> make the first move (although an accidental comment or two could definitely slip free).
                                    
                                    He isn't exactly <i>closeted</i>, perse - that would mean intentionally not telling anyone, after all - he just... doesn't tend to mention his sexuality unless it actually becomes a topic of conversation, either, so that could definitely cause a bit of confusion here and there as well (though, given his general ineptitude with the dating scene, that's likely to be minimal).
                                    
                                    Patience is something pretty important when dating him; less so before the incident, but now it's definitely vital. He's a little jumpy, a little cautious about a lot of things, and it's something that could very easily frustrate someone who isn't willing to wait and help him work through his issues post-trauma. Honestly, it probably sort of means he might not be in the best place to even <i>enter</i> a relationship, but he's somewhat in denial that it's as big of a problem as it is, so... that also wouldn't stop him.
